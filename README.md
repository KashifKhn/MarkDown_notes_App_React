## Description

My Markdown Note-taking App is a simple web application built using ReactMDE, a Markdown editor for React. It allows users to create, edit, and manage Markdown notes. The app includes the following features:

- **Sync Notes with Local Storage:** All your notes are automatically saved and synced with your browser's local storage. This ensures that you never lose your notes, even if you close the app or refresh the page.

- **Add Note Summary Title:** You can add a summary title to each of your notes, making it easier to identify and organize your notes.

- **Modified Notes at the Top:** When you edit a note, it is automatically moved to the top of the notes list. This feature helps you quickly access and prioritize your most recently updated notes.

- **Delete Notes:** You can easily delete notes that you no longer need, helping you keep your note collection organized.
